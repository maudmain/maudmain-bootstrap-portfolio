# maudmain-bootstrap-portfolio

## Project description
This week' bootcamp challenge was to create a portfolio page by applying the core skills we've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables but mainly using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. We will be able to add to this porfolio as the bootcamp progresses

Acceptance Criteria:<br>
The website should include the following bootstrap components:
- A Navigation bar
- A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use bootstrap's navbar or create your own.
- Include links that are applicable to your portfolio (Links should navigate to the appropriate sections).
- A hero section. A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
- A work section. A section displaying your work in grid. Use bootstrap cards for each project. The description should give a brief overview of the work. Each project will eventually link to your class project work!
- A skills section. List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.
- An about / contact section. An "About Me" section in the same row.
- A footer section.
- All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
- All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.
- Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
- Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.

## Usage
With the navigation bar at the top you can view the  "project", "skills", "about me", "contact me" information which are linked to the different sections of the page. This was used using the Bootstrap navbar with hover.<br><br>
The hero section includes a background, my name, a profile picture, a quote, and a clickable button linked to the "about me" section.<br><br>
The "Projects" section shows a few pojects I have worked on. Click on the button to open the deployed project page. This was built using the Bootstarp cards and button with box shadow hover. The cards can be updated as the course progresses.<br><br>
The "Skills" section shows a progress bar for the skills being learned during the bootcamp. this can be updated as teh course progresses.<br><br>
In the "About Me" there is a brief description about myself.<br>
The "Contact Me" section show a few ways to get in touch with me with clickable links. <br>
